This is a list of ideas to work on. When you finish one, check it off and re-check this file (I may have edited it in the background).
- [x] Factor out the S-expression parser into its own file, and write a lot of tests for it
- [x] Using TDD, fix this issue: _find_list_end will get confused by strings with parens.
- [x] Make sure `mise run check` passes again. (This should be something you do before declaring victory on anything, going forward...)
- [x] Don't skip error test cases in test_sexp_parser!
- [x] Don't let the tests succeed if there's a sexp file without a JSON file.
- [x] Using TDD, fix this issue: does anything care about the outermost close paren?
- [x] S-expression parser should be less forgiving: if it sees anything at all surprising, it should fail.
- [x] In _create_transaction_from_data why do you think statuses are ever in the description?
- [x] The table shows transactions but it should show postings
- [ ] Instead of getting the overall balance, it should be getting the cleared balance, as the goal is to make the cleared balance match the target.
- [ ] It should tell you how far the cleared balance is from the target.
